A guy like me. I know why you're holding your little group therapy session in broad daylight. 
I know why you're afraid to go out at night.
Batman.
He's shown Gotham your true colors.
And Dent's just the beginning.
And as for his so-called plan, Batman has no jurisdiction.
He'll find him and make him squeal.
I can tell the squealers every time.
